**TealKit** turns your phone and computer into a powerful agentic AI platform with autonomous agents, built-in tools, and unlimited extensibility. Write your own tools in **JavaScript, Python, PowerShell, or Bash** — or connect any MCP server — and let the AI use them autonomously. Provider-independent, fully customizable, and designed for privacy.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 🤖 AI Playground & Flexibility
* **Provider Independent:** Use leading providers like **Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-5, Anthropic, and Mistral**.
* **Local Intelligence:** Support for **Ollama** models for 100% offline processing.
* **Full Customization:** Tweak model parameters per task and keep token costs predictable.
* **Chat-to-Task:** Test ideas in the chat interface before promoting them to automated tasks.

### 🛠 Built-in AI Skills
* **Document Intelligence:** Local RAG using **DuckDB**. Index PDFs, Word, and Excel files for instant semantic search across your device.
* **Digital Office:** Deep integration with **Gmail** and **Google Calendar** (free) + **Google Drive** (Pro) + universal IMAP/SMTP support.
* **Content & Visualization:** Generate files (TXT, PDF, Excel) and create **Mermaid** diagrams/flowcharts from any data.
* **Web Search & Indexing:** Perform live searches via **SerpApi** or **DuckDuckGo**, and crawl websites for local indexing.
* **Remote Management:** Manage servers via **SSH** on all platforms. On Desktop, generate and execute **Bash scripts** locally (Linux/macOS) or **PowerShell scripts** (Windows).

### ⚙️ Agentic Workflows & Automation
* **Autonomous Execution:** Schedule **cron-based** tasks that run in the background, even when the app is closed.
* **Task Chaining:** Build complex pipelines with conditional logic (e.g., "If X is found, do Y, then email Z").
* **Multi-Channel Output:** Save results to local storage, or send them via **Email, Slack, or WhatsApp** (with attachments).

## 🔌 Extensibility — Add Any Skill, Connect Any Service

TealKit is an **open agentic platform**: every capability not built-in can be added as a custom AI skill or by connecting a third-party MCP server — no boilerplate, no backend required.

### Your Own AI Skills

| Skill Type | Platform | What You Can Do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **JavaScript** | All (Mobile + Desktop) | Write sandboxed custom skills directly in the app — no server, no install needed. |
| **Bash / Shell Script** | Desktop — Linux & macOS | Generate and run shell scripts locally; stdout/stderr feed straight back into the agent. |
| **PowerShell Script** | Desktop — Windows | Generate and execute PowerShell scripts for full Windows automation from a single prompt. |
| **Python MCP Server** | Desktop — all OS | Build complete MCP servers with the built-in editor, instant reload, and full library access. |

### Connect to Existing MCP Servers

| Method | Platform | How It Works |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Import from GitHub** | Desktop | One-click install of any Node.js or Python MCP server straight from a GitHub repository URL. |
| **Glama** | All | Browse the Glama registry inside TealKit and connect any listed server with a single tap. |
| **Smithery** | All | Search the Smithery catalog directly from the app and register cloud-hosted MCP servers instantly. |
| **PulseMCP** | All | Discover servers from the PulseMCP directory and add them to your agent's toolset in one step. |
| **Custom URL** | All | Paste any MCP server URL (SSE or HTTP) to connect private or self-hosted servers. |
